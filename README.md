## Overview

Image classification is an essential task in computer vision and there have been considerable research using traditional handcrafted feature extraction techniques with classical machine learning models and now deep learning techniques. Image classification has several critical uses cases as in self-driving cars, medical image classification and satellite imaging. Here in this paper, we explore the use of Pre-trained Vision Transformer that is fine tuned on a downstream task for image recognition and classification. Self-attention-based Transformer architectures have become the model of choice in natural language processing. In this study, we adapt a traditional transformer architecture for image classification. We compare the experimental results with the handcrafted techniques and CNN models. The paper concludes by providing insights into future studies and potential use cases of Vision-Language Models that combines Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.
